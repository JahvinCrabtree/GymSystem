## Welcome to Spartan Fitness.

This is going to be a newer version of my first real from scartch independant project PPF, taking what I've learend since developing that project and challenging myself to create a far better application with more moving parts, cleaner code and interfaces and just an overall improvement on the original applicaiton!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `resources` : the folder with all the images and whatnot that are used for the GUI.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Day 1 - Started fleshing out the general setup of the dashboards, got a the first iteration of the login and signup page.
